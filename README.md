# C64key2bluetooth

Using a Arduino Pro Mini and UART Bluefriend with HID support to make an old C64 to a ble 4.0 keyboard.

I am sorry about my old 1982 commodore. the Mainboard is
still working. But I only want to use the high quality keyboard
for my modern notebook and desktop system.

Actually it is an improvement - but still usable.

## to do

- more details about the key layout
- circuit/wireing
